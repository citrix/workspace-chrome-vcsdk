# Building examples

## Building a server-side example using `Nmake`

Examples of the latest server-side executables have been provided for testing. You can download the latest Windows Virtual Channel SDK in order to develop the server-side component.

## Building a client-side example

For example on sample apps, see the [download](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-receiver/chrome/receiver-for-chrome-sdk-latest.html) page. 

### Loading Sample virtual channel apps

Citrix provides Chrome packaged apps for each of the example virtual channel. You can load the apps using the following steps

* Open new tab in Chrome browser
* Open `chrome://extensions`
* Ensure the Developer mode checkbox is ticked.
* Click on load unpacked extensions
* Point to the third-party sample app (for example, Ping)
* You can see the app Id which needs to be used to configure Workspace app.

### Configuring the Workspace app

Use one of the configuration methods provided for Workspace app for Chrome configuration.<give link>

Recommended is to push policy using Google Admin Console. The following represents a sample policy file:

```
{
	"settings": {
		"Value": {
			"settings_version": "1.0",
			"engine_settings": {
				"customVC": [ 
					{ // Should be repeated for each virtual channel to be added. Up to 3 virtual channels are supported.
					 "appId": "<third_party_chrome_app_id1>", //Id of the ping or mix or over apps or your own app.
					 "streamName": "<virtual channel name1>" //Here, CTXPING, Mix, or CTXOVER based on the VC you want to try.
					} 
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Running an Example Virtual Channel

1. Copy the server side executables.
2. On the client,
	* Install the third-party Chrome app implementing the virtual channel
	* Configure Workspace app for Chrome.
	* Launch session using Workspace app for Chrome.
