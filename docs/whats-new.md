# What's new

* You can use the HDX SDK for Chrome to set custom configurations for each Citrix Workspace app session. If a third-party Chrome app, embedding Citrix Workspace app, is running in kiosk mode, the Citrix Workspace app policies set in the Google Admin console are not pushed to the device. This feature overcomes this limitation.
* Integrate HDX SDK and Virtual Channel SDK for Citrix Workspace app for Chrome. You can now integrate both the HDX SDK and the Virtual Channel SDK (VC SDK) in a single Chrome app or in separate apps. This feature is supported in both user or public session and in kiosk mode.
