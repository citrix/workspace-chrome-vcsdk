# Citrix Virtual Channel SDK for Citrix Workspace app for Chrome 1808

The Citrix Virtual Channel Software Development Kit (SDK) provides support for writing server-side applications and client-side drivers for additional virtual channels using the ICA protocol. The server-side virtual channel applications are on XenApp or XenDesktop servers. This version of the SDK provides support for writing new virtual channels for Workspace app for Chrome. If you want to write virtual drivers for other client platforms, contact Citrix.

The Virtual Channel SDK provides:

* An easy interface that can be used with the virtual channels in the Citrix Server API SDK (WFAPI SDK) to create new virtual channels.

* The Virtual Channel SDK requires the WFAPI SDK to write the server side of the virtual channel.
